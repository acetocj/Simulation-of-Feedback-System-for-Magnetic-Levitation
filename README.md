# Simulation-of-Feedback-System-for-Magnetic-Levitation
The APEX collaboration (A Positron-Electron eXperiment, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Plasmaphysik) aims to create and study magnetized electron-positron pair plasmas. The plasma will be contained within the magnetic field of a levitated magnetic dipole. A coil of superconducting material, charged with a current via induction, creates the dipole field. The levitation of the dipole is naturally unstable, so an analog control system is implemented to provide stability. In the paper (PDF), I describe a time-domain model of the control system, as well as the results of numerical simulations of the model. Optimal settings for the control system are found, and the system is tested in various situations. The two Python programs were used to simulate and optimize the control system.
